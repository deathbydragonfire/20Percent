#Development Journal - Going Postal
Note:  For the purpose of this journal, weeks will begin on Friday and end Thursday.

## Week 1 (1/29-2/5/16):
My first week was uneventful, as I did not have time to work until Friday.  I downloaded and set the Android SDK with unity and acquired a copy of the Google Developer Console, which is used to manage your apps on the Google Play Store.  I have successfully connected my android device to the unity tester app, so I can test out my programs on it, instead of using an emulator. I am also investigating over tools, like Live2D, which is an animation software, and reacquainting myself with unity and blender.  My goal for the coming week is to research the best tools to use to make apps (specifically game apps, not webpage-like apps) for android.  I will then be doing tutorials and similar things to try to get used to the workflow and tools. I hope to start my prototype by next friday, and complete it in that week. 

## Week 2 (2/6 - 2/12/16):
This week I spent a lot of time experimenting.  I have decided that I definitely want to use Unity as my engine, and have done a few tutorials to try to get myself up to speed with using it.  Additionally, I spent a good portion of the week investigating Live 2D, which was a very interesting and promising animation software.  However, I have determined that I want nothing to do with it, since it is expensive (evidentally $275 to use any of the actually useful content, even though it said it was free on their website...) and insanely time consuming.  I decided such a thing was not worth it or strictly needed.  I spent a little time with Blender, but decided my design is better suited for 2D than 3D.  I feel a bit behind, since I have not started on my actual product, but I find it hard to find the time during the week to work on this side project.  It was a busy week this week with tests and being sick and all, but I look forward to a nice long weekend to hopefully put a dent in this.
