#Development Journal - Going Postal
Note:  For the purpose of this journal, weeks will begin on Friday and end Thursday.

## Week 1 (1/29-2/5/16):
My first week was uneventful, as I did not have time to work until Friday.  I downloaded and set the Android SDK with unity and acquired a copy of the Google Developer Console, which is used to manage your apps on the Google Play Store.  I have successfully connected my android device to the unity tester app, so I can test out my programs on it, instead of using an emulator. I am also investigating over tools, like Live2D, which is an animation software, and reacquainting myself with unity and blender.  My goal for the coming week is to research the best tools to use to make apps (specifically game apps, not webpage-like apps) for android.  I will then be doing tutorials and similar things to try to get used to the workflow and tools. I hope to start my prototype by next friday, and complete it in that week.
