# Proposal: Going Postal
## The Fast-Paced Mail Sorting Game

## Needs and Opportunities
The mobile games market is set to reach $45 billion dollars by 2018, according to digi-capital.com.  Clearly it is a large segment of the market, especially for "casual" gamers who are not looking for a 60 minute play session, but one more between 5 and 10 minutes.  Many of the games that become successful in this market are not complex or epic, but have solid, unique, and interesing mechanics.  They do not require large amounts of content to be successful, and a smaller screen size means less than current generation graphics are better suited for the medium. This makes it a perfect place to work and produce a game in a relatively short amount of time, with few resources.

## Audience / Clients / Users
My audience is a person on a bus, a train, waiting for a commercial to finish, or microwaving their TV dinners.  It is a person looking to pass time without significant commitment.  Thus, a meaningful play session much be achieved within the 2 to 10 minute timeframe.  I intend to publish my game on the Android Store.  I have chosen Android because I don't own a Mac, and I'm not buying one.

## Product
The product will be a functional game, available on the Andriod Store.

## Reality Check
Tools I plan on using and cost:

 	Unity - Free
 	Paint Tool Sai - $45 (was gonna buy anyway)
 	Inkscape - Free
 	Visual Studios 2013 - Free
 	Sublime Text - Free

 	Youtube Videos - Free
 	Stack Overflow - Free
 	C# Book - Already Own

## Conclusion
The main goal of this experience is to learn.  I am stepping a bit out of my comfort zone, as I've never made a real video game before, much less on for a mobile device.  I know there are lots of unique design problems inherent to my chosen platform, and I'm excited to face those challenges.  By the end of this project I hope to have learned about producing and publishing a mobile game, and be able to better do it again.
